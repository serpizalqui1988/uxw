## Common Mistakes to Avoid in Your Personal Statement

Writing a personal statement is a delicate process, and many applicants make mistakes that can hurt their chances. Some of the most common mistakes include:

- **Being too generic:** Avoid using clichés or vague statements. Your personal statement should be unique to you, not just a generic list of achievements.
- **Excessive focus on the past:** While it’s important to mention your background, your personal statement should primarily focus on your future goals and why you’re a good fit for the program or job.
- **Neglecting proofreading:** Spelling and grammatical errors can make you look unprofessional. Always proofread your personal statement or, better yet, have an expert help you ensure it’s error-free.
